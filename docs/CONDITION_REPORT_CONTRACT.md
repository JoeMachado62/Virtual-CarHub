# Condition Report Payload Contract

**Audience:** the coding agent / engineer maintaining the OVE scraper. Read
this together with [SCRAPER_CONTRACT.md](./SCRAPER_CONTRACT.md), which
specifies the lease queue lifecycle; *this* document specifies the **shape
of the `condition_report` dict** you POST to
`/api/v1/inventory/ove/detail/{vin}`.

It exists because the current payload schema
(`backend/app/schemas/ove_inventory.py::OveDetailPushRequest.condition_report`)
is typed as `dict[str, Any]` — the VPS accepts whatever the scraper sends
and stores it verbatim. There is no server-side extraction. If a field is
missing from the payload, the frontend template renders an empty section.

The "rich" condition report template was introduced in commit `c94faa5`
(2026-03-20) and lives at
`frontend/components/ConditionReportDocument.tsx`. Every field enumerated
below is a key that template reads. If you ship a payload that omits these
fields, the CR page degrades to a vehicle summary card with no tire grid,
no damage table, no announcements, and no vehicle history — which is the
exact regression we are debugging right now.

---

## 1. Where the data lives on Manheim

A correct CR scrape for a single VIN requires data from **two** Manheim
sources. Losing either source loses half the CR.

| Source | URL pattern | What it provides |
|---|---|---|
| **OVE listing JSON** | `https://www.ove.com/...` listing page (JSON embedded in `__NEXT_DATA__` or equivalent) | Announcements, autocheck (owners/accidents), arbitrationRating, conditionGrade, gallery images, seller comments, title status, `conditionReportUrl` pointer to the Manheim CR HTML page |
| **Manheim CR HTML page** | `http://content.liquidmotors.com/IR/{dealer_id}/{cr_id}.html` (value comes from `conditionReportUrl` on the listing JSON) | Tire tread depths, damage items (panels + severity), structural damage, paint condition, interior condition, remarks, severity summary |

**Tire depths and damage items do not exist on the listing JSON.** They
only exist on the `liquidmotors.com` CR page. If your scraper stops
fetching that page, tire + damage fields go empty on every vehicle. This
is the most common failure mode.

---

## 2. Top-level payload shape

```jsonc
POST /api/v1/inventory/ove/detail/{vin}
{
  "source_platform": "manheim",
  "images": [ /* see §4 */ ],
  "condition_report": {
    /* see §3 — all keys below are siblings of this object */
  },
  "seller_comments": "string | null",
  "listing_snapshot": { /* unchanged, see ove_inventory.py */ },
  "sync_metadata": { /* freeform, for scraper-side correlation */ }
}
```

`condition_report` and `images` are the two fields that matter for the
CR page. Everything else is orthogonal.

---

## 3. `condition_report` field-by-field spec

All keys are optional from the schema's perspective (the Pydantic type is
`dict[str, Any]`), but each key below is **required for its corresponding
section of the template to render non-empty.** Where a section becomes
empty, the template either hides it or shows a placeholder, which the
user reads as "the CR is broken."

### 3.1 Identification / grade

| Key | Type | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `overall_grade` | `string` | OVE listing JSON `conditionGrade` or CR HTML grade header | e.g. `"3.5"`. Also drives the `CONDITION DETAIL` section via `hasStructuredData()`. |
| `structural_damage` | `string \| null` | CR HTML | e.g. `"None Reported"` or a description. |
| `paint_condition` | `string` | CR HTML | e.g. `"Very Good"`. |
| `interior_condition` | `string` | CR HTML | e.g. `"Good"`. |
| `tire_condition` | `string` | CR HTML | Summary string, separate from `tire_depths`. |

### 3.2 `metadata` — required for the Manheim CR deep link

```jsonc
"metadata": {
  "report_link": {
    "href": "http://content.liquidmotors.com/IR/15614/38020971.html",
    "title": "3.5"   // optional; used as fallback grade label
  },
  "announcementsEnrichment": {
    "announcements": ["Open Recall", "Previous Canadian"]
  }
}
```

**This is load-bearing.** The backend extracts the Manheim CR URL from
`condition_report.metadata.report_link.href` in
`backend/app/api/v1/routers/inventory.py::_extract_cr_url` and returns it
as `vehicle.condition_report_url`. The template's "See Original Condition
Report" button depends on this path. If you put the URL anywhere else
(e.g. top-level `condition_report_url` or `raw_text`), the button will
not appear.

`metadata.announcementsEnrichment.announcements` is a secondary source
the template falls back to if `announcements` (see §3.3) is missing or
empty. Populate both when possible.

### 3.3 Announcements & remarks

| Key | Type | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `announcements` | `string[]` | OVE listing JSON `announcementsEnrichment.announcements` | Each item ≤ 400 chars. Longer items are dropped by the template as a guard against JSON blobs leaking in. |
| `remarks` | `string[]` | CR HTML remarks section | Free-text bullets. |
| `seller_comments_items` | `string[]` | OVE listing seller block (split) | If empty, template falls back to top-level `seller_comments`. |
| `problem_highlights` | `string[]` | Scraper-derived | Optional "top issues" summary rendered above announcements. |
| `ai_summary` | `string` | Scraper-derived (optional) | Narrative summary; rendered as its own section if present. |

### 3.4 `vehicle_history`

```jsonc
"vehicle_history": {
  "owners": 2,          // int, from autocheck.ownerCount
  "accidents": 0,       // int, from autocheck.numberOfAccidents
  "engine_starts": true,  // bool, from CR HTML
  "drivable": true        // bool, from CR HTML
}
```

Drives the `VEHICLE HISTORY` section and the Engine Starts / Drivable
bullets in the grade card.

### 3.5 `autocheck` — required when OVE exposes AutoCheck data

If the OVE listing/source page exposes an AutoCheck block, send it as a
top-level `condition_report.autocheck` object. Do not leave it only in
`metadata.listing_json.autocheck`; the backend has a partial fallback for
legacy OVE fields, but the rich graphic section depends on the explicit
normalized fields below.

```jsonc
"autocheck": {
  "scrape_status": "success",              // success | partial | failed | not_attempted
  "attempted_at": "2026-04-26T09:00:00Z",  // ISO-8601 UTC

  "autocheck_score": 94,       // int
  "score_range_low": 91,       // int
  "score_range_high": 96,      // int
  "score_range_label": "Pickup - Fullsize",

  "historical_event_count": 32,
  "owner_count": 1,
  "accident_count": 1,
  "last_reported_event_date": "2026-03-03",
  "last_reported_mileage": 16171,

  "title_brand_check": "OK",
  "accident_check": "Information Reported(1)",
  "damage_check": "OK",
  "odometer_check": "OK",
  "other_title_brand_event_check": "OK",
  "vehicle_use": "Other Use Reported",
  "buyback_protection": "Qualifies",

  "report_logo_url": "https://...",        // optional logo image URL
  "view_report_href": "https://...",       // optional source/report URL
  "full_report_text": "optional plain-text transcript"
}
```

Field rules:

- Numeric values must be JSON numbers, not formatted strings.
- `last_reported_event_date` must be `YYYY-MM-DD` when known.
- `full_report_text` must be plain text and should be capped at 16,000
  characters.
- Use `scrape_status="partial"` only when the scraper captured enough
  data to render a truthful section but some non-critical fields are
  missing. Use `failed` when AutoCheck was attempted and did not load.
- The canonical check-row display values are `OK`,
  `Information Reported(n)`, `Other Use Reported`, `Qualifies`,
  `Not Eligible`, and `Unknown`. If AutoCheck provides a more specific
  short display phrase, preserve it.
- `other_title_brand_event_check` is separate from `title_brand_check`.
  Do not duplicate one field into the other unless the source truly only
  exposes a combined value.

### 3.6 `damage_items` + `damage_summary`

```jsonc
"damage_items": [
  {
    "section": "front_bumper",
    "section_label": "Front Bumper",
    "panel": "Lower",
    "condition": "Scratched",
    "reported_severity": "Minor",
    "severity_label": "Minor",
    "severity_color": "yellow",  // one of: green | yellow | orange | red | gray
    "severity_rank": 2
  }
],
"damage_summary": {
  "total_items": 7,
  "by_color": { "yellow": 5, "orange": 2 },
  "by_section": { "front_bumper": 2, "driver_door": 1 },
  "structural_issue": false
}
```

Source: CR HTML damage map (SVG overlay + tabular list).
`severity_color` drives the colored pill in the damage table — the
template classes are `cr-severity-{color}` so stick to the five values
above.

### 3.7 `tire_depths`

```jsonc
"tire_depths": {
  "lf": {
    "position_label": "LF",
    "tread_depth": "6/32",
    "brand": "Michelin",
    "size": "245/45R19",
    "wheel_type": "Alloy"
  },
  "rf": { /* ... */ },
  "lr": { /* ... */ },
  "rr": { /* ... */ }
}
```

Keyed map. Position keys are lowercase (`lf`, `rf`, `lr`, `rr`, or
`spare`). Source: CR HTML tire section. The `TIRE CONDITION` section is
hidden entirely if this object is missing or empty.

### 3.8 Title info

| Key | Type | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `title_status` | `string` | CR HTML |
| `title_state` | `string` (2-letter) | CR HTML |
| `title_branding` | `string` | CR HTML |

The `TITLE INFORMATION` section only renders if at least one of these is
present.

### 3.9 Color fallbacks

| Key | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `exterior_color` | `string` | Fallback only — the top-level vehicle record's `exterior_color` wins. |
| `interior_color` | `string` | Same. |

### 3.10 `severity_summary`

`string` — a one-line narrative (e.g. `"7 minor items, 2 moderate, no
structural."`) rendered below the damage table. Optional.

### 3.11 `raw_text`

`string` — the full listing/CR dump as a single blob. The template uses
this **only as a last-resort fallback** when structured fields are
missing (old scraper format). **Do not rely on this.** The template
explicitly does *not* regex announcements out of `raw_text` when
`raw_text` looks JSON-shaped, because that leaked a 51k-character JSON
blob into a single bullet — see the inline comment at
`ConditionReportDocument.tsx:124`.

If you send `raw_text`, cap it. Anything over ~16kb is almost certainly
a bug.

---

## 4. `images` — CR-grade gallery

This is a **separate** payload field from `condition_report`, but it is
part of the same regression (scraper sending 1 image instead of the full
set). Schema:

```jsonc
"images": [
  {
    "url": "https://cdn.manheim.com/.../photo1.jpg",
    "role": "gallery",          // gallery | inspection | disclosure | hero
    "display_order": 0,
    "is_primary": true,
    "source_image_id": "optional scraper-side id",
    "metadata": {}
  }
]
```

Rules:
- **Send the full OVE gallery**, not just the first thumbnail. The OVE
  listing JSON has the complete image array; use it.
- **Do not send** `.svg`, `.gif`, or `ready_logistics.png` — these are
  filtered out by the frontend and treated as non-photo assets.
  ([resolveReportImages](../frontend/components/ConditionReportDocument.tsx#L748))
- Strip any `?size=` query parameter or let the frontend strip it (it
  does, for deduplication). But try to send the original-resolution URL.
- Mark one image `is_primary: true`. This becomes the hero.
- `role: "inspection"` and `role: "disclosure"` images are rendered in
  their own sub-galleries on the CR page.

The OVE listing JSON is the authoritative source — do not fall back to
Imagin Studio / stock photos for auction inventory. Imagin belongs to
retail inventory only.

---

## 5. Minimal payload checklist

Before POSTing, verify the payload contains at least these keys or
expect a visibly broken CR page:

- [ ] `condition_report.metadata.report_link.href` — URL to liquidmotors CR page
- [ ] `condition_report.announcements` OR `condition_report.metadata.announcementsEnrichment.announcements`
- [ ] `condition_report.vehicle_history.owners` and `.accidents`
- [ ] `condition_report.autocheck` when OVE exposes AutoCheck data, including score/range, event counts, check rows, and optional report URL
- [ ] `condition_report.damage_items` (array, possibly empty — but only empty if the CR page itself reports no damage)
- [ ] `condition_report.tire_depths` with 4 positions (lf/rf/lr/rr)
- [ ] `condition_report.overall_grade`
- [ ] `images` with **at least** the full OVE gallery (typically 10–40 items)

If `damage_items` is empty AND `tire_depths` is empty AND the listing was
scraped successfully, your scraper almost certainly failed to fetch the
liquidmotors CR HTML — that is the single most common cause of "CR
looks empty" incidents. Log the CR URL fetch separately so this failure
is visible.

---

## 6. Partial-data protocol

Manheim changes their HTML periodically and individual fields will break
before the whole page does. The scraper should:

1. **Never** silently drop a section. If tire depths fail to parse but
   damage items succeed, send the damage items and omit `tire_depths`
   (do not send `{}`). The template hides the tire section when the
   object is missing; sending `{}` renders nothing but costs a diff.
2. Add a `condition_report.metadata.scrape_warnings` array with one
   string per field that failed to parse, e.g.
   `["tire_depths: selector .tire-grid not found"]`. The template does
   not render this today, but the field is reserved for it and the
   backend will store it.
3. If the liquidmotors CR page itself 404s or times out, still POST the
   listing-JSON-derived fields (announcements, owners/accidents,
   overall_grade from listing, images, seller comments) and **use
   `/fail` with `error_category=page_structure_changed` or
   `transient_network`** so the request retries. Do not `/complete` a
   half-empty CR.
4. If the liquidmotors CR page is permanently missing (listing type that
   has no CR), use `/terminal` with
   `reason=unsupported_listing_type`.

---

## 7. Golden example

A canonical example payload belongs at
`backend/tests/fixtures/ove/condition_report_golden.json` with:

- 1 vehicle with `overall_grade=3.5`
- 4 tire positions with real depths
- 7–10 damage items across 3+ severity colors
- 2+ announcements
- `vehicle_history` with non-zero accidents
- 15+ gallery images
- Full `metadata.report_link.href`

Both sides can diff their output against that file. **This fixture does
not exist yet** — capturing one from a known-good snapshot (or a `c94faa5`-era
`raw_text` dump) is the next concrete step before we can regression-test
the scraper.

---

## 8. Schema evolution

Today `condition_report` is `dict[str, Any]`. Once the contract above is
stable, the backend should replace it with a typed
`ConditionReportPayload(BaseModel)` in `backend/app/schemas/ove_inventory.py`
that validates the shape at the boundary. Until then, the VPS accepts
anything, which is what allowed this regression to go unnoticed for a
week — the backend has no way to say "this payload is missing its tire
grid." Typing the schema is the long-term fix; this document is the
short-term fix.

---

## 9. Quick reference — canonical field list

These are every key the rich template reads, in the order they appear in
`ConditionReportDocument.tsx`:

```
condition_report.metadata
condition_report.metadata.report_link.href
condition_report.metadata.report_link.title
condition_report.metadata.announcementsEnrichment.announcements

condition_report.autocheck.autocheck_score
condition_report.autocheck.score_range_low
condition_report.autocheck.score_range_high
condition_report.autocheck.score_range_label
condition_report.autocheck.historical_event_count
condition_report.autocheck.owner_count
condition_report.autocheck.accident_count
condition_report.autocheck.last_reported_event_date
condition_report.autocheck.last_reported_mileage

condition_report.tire_depths[pos].position_label
condition_report.tire_depths[pos].tread_depth
condition_report.tire_depths[pos].brand
condition_report.tire_depths[pos].size
condition_report.tire_depths[pos].wheel_type
condition_report.problem_highlights[]

condition_report.interior_color             (fallback)
images[].url
images[].role
images[].display_order
images[].is_primary
```

That is the universe. If a field is not on this list, the template does
not read it and the scraper should not waste time populating it.
